# Social Resume Database

# Facebook + Linkedin = Facedin (Social Resume Database)

In this project, I have integrated two database models given as a startup kit. The first one is similar to Facebook database model and the second one resembles to LinkedIn database model.  

DESIGN-CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 

I have created an EER diagram for each of the application. The output of this step is 2 EER diagrams, one for Facebook and the other one for LinkedIn. I have create an EER diagram for Social Resume Database also.

DESIGN-LOGICAL MODEL 

I have converted each EER diagram into relational model.
I also have integrated the relational models into the social resume database.

IMPLEMENTATION-PHYSICAL MODEL 

I have writed some triggers, check constraints, assertion and some basic select, insert, update, delete statements.
